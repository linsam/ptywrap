My own pty wrapper. Intended for use in execline scripts. Mostly intended for
s6 services when launching a daemon that logs to stdout instead of stderror
and doesn't change its stdout to line-buffering.

Should work similar to DJB's getpty or ptyget or whatever it was called.

That utility was only licensed for unmodified redistribution, so I didn't look
at the source code.

This is intended to be GPL or BSD or something redistributable (I haven't
decided yet)
